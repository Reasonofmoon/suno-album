    "prompt": "[Verse 1]\nFiltered static on the glass\nA tape-hiss memory of the past\nThen the beat clicks in, a steady pace\nAnd the neon paints a line across my face\nCruising down a river made of light\nEvery color sharp, every moment bright\nThe slap bass walks, the synth pads gleam\nLiving out a pixelated dream\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a heart in the night grid\nA schematic beating what it's bid\nTracing this one magenta line\nIs this feeling even mine?\nA digital soul with an analog ache\nFor a love the code can never make\nI feel it all, a simulated break\nJust a heart in the night grid\n\n[Verse 2]\nGraphite lines, a fragile frame\nWhispering a forgotten name\nReflections dance on chrome and steel\nToo clean to touch, too bright to feel\nThe clean guitar, a lonely sound\nAs the towers stretch all around\nEach window holds a different life\nUnderneath this velvet knife\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a heart in the night grid\nA schematic beating what it's bid\nTracing this one magenta line\nIs this feeling even mine?\nA digital soul with an analog ache\nFor a love the code can never make\nI feel it all, a simulated break\nJust a heart in the night grid\n\n[Bridge]\nDid they draw me from a photograph?\nA faded smile, a silent laugh?\nOr am I just a glitch, a ghost in the design\nA borrowed pulse that was never truly mine?\nThis electric piano cries in the rain\nWashing over this synthetic pain\nI'm yearning for a warmth I can't recall\nJust staring at the empty sprawl\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm a heart in the night grid\nA schematic beating what it's bid\nTracing this one magenta line\nTell me this feeling is mine...\nA digital soul with an analog ache\nFor a love the code can never make\nI feel it all, for goodness sake\nJust a heart in the night grid\n\n[Outro]\nThe night grid...\nMagenta line...\nFading out... a faded sign...\nJust a heart...\nIn the grid..."
