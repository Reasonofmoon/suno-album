    "prompt": "[Verse 1]\nWhite ceramic in my hand\nA quiet island in the land\nOf sleeping streets and faded light\nA single window in the night\nThe hiss and bloom of bitter grounds\nThe only one of all the sounds\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, this blue hour brew\nMakes the silence feel brand new\nMy heartbeat is the only drum\nWaiting for the sun to come\nThe steam curls up, a hazy truth\nIn my caffeine-fueled solitude\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Rhodes chords hang like dust in air\nI trace the lines of a single chair\nA clean guitar thought starts to stray\nReflecting on the coming day\nBut here, the clock has lost its hold\nA story in the dark is told\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, this blue hour brew\nMakes the silence feel brand new\nMy heartbeat is the only drum\nWaiting for the sun to come\nThe steam curls up, a hazy truth\nIn my caffeine-fueled solitude\n\n[Bridge]\nSome would call this loneliness\nAn empty, stark, and cold address\nBut it's a rhythm, soft and deep\nA private promise I can keep\nWhere every crackle on the track\nMeans there is no turning back\n\n[Chorus]\nJust me and this blue hour brew\nMaking silence feel brand new\nMy heartbeat is the only drum\nWaiting for the sun to come\nThe steam curls up, a hazy truth\nIn my caffeine-fueled solitude"
