    "prompt": "[Verse 1]\nGraphite lines on a paper seat\nThis rattle-hum is a faded beat\nWindow frames a pale blue smear\nWatching stations disappear\nEvery ghost is just a name\nFlickering inside the frame\n\n[Chorus]\nFloating in these fluorescent dreams\nJust a ghost in the machine\nWhile the city sleeps in seams of gray\nLet the silence pull me away\nYeah, the silence pulls me away\n\n[Verse 2]\nEvery street light, a memory\nAn echo of who I used to be\nDon't know where this tunnel bends\nOn this quiet, my soul depends\nTracing maps on frosted glass\nHoping that the feeling lasts\n\n[Chorus]\nFloating in these fluorescent dreams\nJust a ghost in the machine\nWhile the city sleeps in seams of gray\nLet the silence pull me away\nYeah, the silence pulls me away\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I'm not running from\nAnything or anyone\nJust a body in the sway\nOf this empty, steel ballet\nLost between the stop and start\nJust the beating of my heart\n\n[Chorus]\nFloating in these fluorescent dreams\n(In these dreams)\nJust a ghost in the machine\n(In the machine)\nWhile the city sleeps in seams of gray\nLet the silence pull me away\nYeah, the silence pulls me away"
