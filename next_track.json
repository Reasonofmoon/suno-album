    "prompt": "[Verse 1]\nThe pane is cool against my hand tonight\nWatching silver rivers chase the light\nA muted beat is pulsing in the space\nWhile vinyl static puts on a soft-worn face\nAnd through the haze, a single, simple truth\nA vertical line of pale electric youth\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the midnight blur\nA quiet lullaby of what we were\nJust the neon rain that's falling on the glass\nA perfect, lonely moment, built to last\nA silhouette that's bathed in indigo\nWatching the city breathe, soft and slow\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe Rhodes chords hang like smoke inside the room\nA fretless bass to navigate the gloom\nEach chorus-laden guitar lick, a tear\nThat traces paths of hope and quiet fear\nThey echo off the buildings down below\nA whispered melody I used to know\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the midnight blur\nA quiet lullaby of what we were\nJust the neon rain that's falling on the glass\nA perfect, lonely moment, built to last\nA silhouette that's bathed in indigo\nWatching the city breathe, soft and slow\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd in this solitude, I'm not alone\nI feel the city's pulse inside my bones\nIt isn't sad, this solitary art\nIt's just the steady beating of a heart\nThat found its rhythm in the falling sound\nOn this forgotten, consecrated ground\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the midnight blur\nA quiet lullaby of what we were\nJust the neon rain that's falling on the glass\nA perfect, lonely moment, built to last\nA silhouette that's bathed in indigo\nWatching the city breathe, soft and slow"
