    "prompt": "[Verse 1]\nThree-fifteen on a muted screen\nJust the hum of the machine\nAnd the vinyl crackle in the space\nWhere the pillow holds an empty place\nA soft indent, a faded line\nA ghost of peace I thought was mine\n\n[Chorus]\nBut oh, the silence makes it loud\nEvery whisper in the crowd is me\nFloating in the blue hour static\nWhere the truth feels automatic\nAnd every thought is crystal clear\nI hear it all when no one's here\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere’s a silver wire, a pale blue thread\nCuts across the unmade bed\nFrom the blinds, a single ray\nWashing all the grey away\nIt lands upon the bedroom floor\nShows me what I came here for\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, the silence makes it loud\nEvery whisper in the crowd is me\nFloating in the blue hour static\nWhere the truth feels automatic\nAnd every thought is crystal clear\nI hear it all when no one's here\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the pause between the dark and dawn\nEvery mask I wear is gone\nThere's no one left to lie to now\nJust the ceiling and a silent vow\nTo remember what this quiet taught\nThe honest shape of every thought\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, the silence makes it loud\nEvery whisper in the crowd is me\nFloating in the blue hour static\nWhere the truth feels automatic\nAnd every thought is crystal clear\nI hear it all when no one's here\n\n[Outro]\nThe blue remains...\nThe static fades...\nJust a breath... fades..."
