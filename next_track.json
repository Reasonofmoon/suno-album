    "prompt": "[Intro]\nStatic hiss... a charcoal line...\nIs this memory even mine?\n\n[Verse 1]\nLinnDrum clicks a steady beat\nOn this simulated street\nHeadlights cut the rendered haze\nLost inside these data days\nGot a lacquer-coated soul\nFighting for a ghost's control\nEngine hums a quiet plea\nFor a past that can't be me\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, this digital sunset's bleeding low\nA pixelated, pale magenta glow\nJust a memory in the code I trace\nMy chrome heart aching in this empty space\nYeah, the feeling's real, the world is fake\nIn the after-image of a beautiful mistake\n\n[Verse 2]\nRhodes chords shimmer in the air\nCatch a face that isn't there\nReflected in the window stream\nLiving out a lo-fi dream\nEvery wire inside my frame\nStill remembers how to whisper a name\nSmooth and sleek and incomplete\nThis melancholy is bittersweet\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, this digital sunset's bleeding low\nA pixelated, pale magenta glow\nJust a memory in the code I trace\nMy chrome heart aching in this empty space\nYeah, the feeling's real, the world is fake\nIn the after-image of a beautiful mistake\n\n[Bridge]\nIs this ache just phantom data?\nDoes the circuit even matter?\nWhen the feeling's synthesized but true\nThis fragile line that's fading from the view...\nJust one signal breaking through...\n\n[Outro]\nFading... fading into white...\nJust the taillights in the night...\nThat magenta bleed...\nFading...\nFading...\n...gone."
