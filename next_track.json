    "prompt": "[Verse 1]\nThe sound is off, the room is white\nJust pencil lines in fading light\nA hollow space behind my chest\nWhere heavy thoughts are laid to rest\nThe air is still, the dust is, too\nA grayscale photograph of you\nNo, not of you... just of the frame\nWhere I forgot to speak your name\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, I'm sinking slow and low\nInto the velvet void I know\nThis heavy comfort, soft and deep\nA quiet promise I can keep\nNo need to feel, no need to try\nJust indigo in my mind's eye\nA beautiful and numb embrace\nLosing my sense of time and place\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy fingers trace a surface, black\nA single touch and no way back\nThe ripples start, a silent bloom\nTo fill the corners of the room\nThe beat drops out, I'm holding breath\nA lovely, temporary death\nSuspended in the atmosphere\nThere is no pain, there is no fear\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, I'm sinking slow and low\nInto the velvet void I know\nThis heavy comfort, soft and deep\nA quiet promise I can keep\nNo need to feel, no need to try\nJust indigo in my mind's eye\nA beautiful and numb embrace\nLosing my sense of time and place\n\n[Bridge]\nThey say the ache will come for me\nA tidal wave of memory\nBut in the space where sound should be\nA lush and dark eternity\nThis sweet surrender feels like grace\nA stillness nothing can replace\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd oh, I'm sinking slow and low\nInto the velvet void I know\nThis heavy comfort, soft and deep\nA quiet promise I can keep\nNo need to feel, no need to try\nJust indigo in my mind's eye\nA beautiful and numb embrace\nLosing my sense of time and place"
