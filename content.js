Pillow's gone cold on the other side
Nowhere left for me to hide
Ceiling stares back, a field of white
Cut in half by pale blue light
Streetlamp's drawing tracings on the wall
Waiting for a call that's not a call
And I ask the empty space beside my head
All the words I should have said

[Chorus]
Oh, the blue hour echo
Is the only sound I know
It's the beat behind the beat, quiet and slow
Just the sound of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... hello, you

[Verse 2]
Static hums on the window glass
Watching hazy silhouettes pass
Every ghost I used to know
Puts on another quiet show
The vinyl hiss inside my brain
Washes out just like the rain
And I trace the dust that dances in the beam
Living out a waking dream

[Chorus]
Oh, the blue hour echo
Is the only sound I know
It's the beat behind the beat, quiet and slow
Just the sound of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... hello, you

[Bridge]
Is this a kind of peace I've found?
This quiet, hollow, sacred ground?
Or is it just a slow release
From a world that will not cease?
This voice that answers in the grey
Does it want me to run or stay?

[Chorus]
It's the blue hour echo
The only sound I really know
A rhythm in the blood, quiet and slow
The hum of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... it's only you`,

            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
Three A.M. on the window pane
A silver sketch of falling rain
Each shaky line, a liquid track
On a night that won't give morning back
The city breathes a quiet sigh
Beneath a sleeping, velvet sky
And in this hush, I'm the only sound
On holy, empty, silent ground

[Chorus]
This is my Urban Nocturne
A song the lonely streetlights learn
The world outside is washed in gray
And built for me to drift away
The beat is slow, the bass is deep
A promise that the shadows keep
This fragile stage, this glowing ache
A city sleeping for my sake

[Verse 2]
A distant sign, a faded stain
A smudge of magenta in the rain
It melts and bleeds across the glass
A ghost of moments meant to pass
The guitar shimmers, clean and low
Reflecting light on the pavement's glow
Each chord a question, soft and clear
On why I'm still awake and here

[Chorus]
This is my Urban Nocturne
A song the lonely streetlights learn
The world outside is washed in gray
And built for me to drift away
The beat is slow, the bass is deep
A promise that the shadows keep
This fragile stage, this glowing ache
A city sleeping for my sake

[Bridge]
They call it solitude, I know
But in this calm, my feelings grow
It isn't lonely, it's just true
A world reduced to me and you
Oh, sleeping city, in your dream
You flow like a forgotten stream
And I'm just here to watch you run
Until the coming of the sun

[Chorus]
And sing my Urban Nocturne
A song the lonely streetlights learn
The world outside is washed in gray
And built for me to drift away
The beat is slow, the bass is deep
A promise that the shadows keep
This fragile stage, this glowing ache
A city sleeping for my sake`,

            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
Streetlights paint a faded square
On the kitchen wall tonight
White ceramic, holding darkness there
A pool of bitter light
The city hums a single note
A quiet, sleeping gray
And I just watch the seconds float
And drift and fade away

[Chorus]
Just a circle, black and deep
In this porcelain stillness
Secrets that the silence keep
Is it freedom, or is it loneliness?
A single wisp of pale blue steam
A quiet, rising thread
Lost inside a waking dream
With the words I never said

[Verse 2]
Hear that quiet, jazzy line
A thought that starts to trace
A question that is only mine
In this solitary space
Remember when the world was loud?
A rush of sound and speed
Now I'm standing in a silver cloud
Planting a single seed

[Chorus]
Just a circle, black and deep
In this porcelain stillness
Secrets that the silence keep
Is it freedom, or is it loneliness?
A single wisp of pale blue steam
A quiet, rising thread
Lost inside a waking dream
With the words I never said

[Bridge]
And I find a strange and simple grace
In the echo of my own heartbeat
My reflection in this liquid space
Is the only one I meet
There's no answer I have to find
No reason and no rhyme
Just the comfort of my own mind
Suspended here in time

[Outro]
Porcelain stillness
Yeah...
Just this stillness
Fading now...
Just this...`,

Pale blue light on the window pane
Hums a rhythm through the rain
Just my shadow on the seat
Fading lines, incomplete
Empty platform, lonely name
Every echo sounds the same
Carriage sways to a phantom beat
Beneath the pulse of sleeping streets

[Chorus]
In these fluorescent dreams, I'm on the midnight line
Losing all the track of forgotten space and time
This metallic, soft-spun lullaby
Is the only reason why
I feel alive under this humming sky
Drifting by

[Verse 2]
Concrete towers, soft and blurred
A quiet promise, never heard
Every station, not a word
Just a ghost that goes unstirred
No destination in my head
Only looping thoughts instead
A million stories sleeping sound
While I am drifting underground

[Chorus]
In these fluorescent dreams, I'm on the midnight line
Losing all the track of forgotten space and time
This metallic, soft-spun lullaby
Is the only reason why
I feel alive under this humming sky
Drifting by

[Bridge]
And the bass just walks a steady pace
Reflecting nothing on my face
Is this freedom, or just grace?
To disappear without a trace
In the rhythm of this place...

In these fluorescent dreams, I'm on the midnight line
Losing all the track of forgotten space and time
This metallic, soft-spun lullaby

I feel alive under this humming sky

The lonely sine. A pale blue thought, adrift on a frequency of nothing.

Drawn in lines of graphite space
Tracing arcs I can't erase
Got this slow-wave in my core
Always wanting something more
Just a soft Rhodes in the haze
Living out my sleepless days

[Chorus]
And I send a signal through the night
Just a single pulse of lonely light
Can you hear my echo in the orbit?
A quiet sound, you just ignore it
Just a whisper lost inside the black
A love you'll never broadcast back

[Verse 2]
Watch your tiny world unfold
A story I am never told
Through a window made of glass
I see the seasons slowly pass
You don't know I'm up above
Suspended in this phantom love

[Chorus]
And I send a signal through the night
Just a single pulse of lonely light
Can you hear my echo in the orbit?
A quiet sound, you just ignore it
Just a whisper lost inside the black
A love you'll never broadcast back

[Bridge]
If my frequency should fade
A memory I never made
Would the silence feel the same?
Would you ever speak my name?
Or am I just a tear that's frozen
On a path I haven't chosen?

Graphite lines across the ceiling
Tracing every muted feeling
Static hums a low complaint
A tired kind of self-restraint
Counting cracks instead of sheep
While secrets that I couldn't keep
Are whispering from chasms deep

[Chorus]
But when I close my eyes and fall
Through porcelain hours, soft and slow
I tint the air with lilac glow
And watch a silent garden grow
This is a quiet I can hold
More precious than a vein of gold

[Verse 2]
No heavy thoughts, no gravity
Just paper cranes that fly for me
The beat behind my ribs is low
A tempo only I can know
The pillow's cool on the other side
A vacant space I try to hide
But here, the cotton is a sea
And I just let it carry me

[Chorus]
'Cause when I close my eyes and fall
Through porcelain hours, soft and slow
I tint the air with lilac glow
And watch a silent garden grow
This is a quiet I can hold
More precious than a vein of gold

[Bridge]
Is it real, this gentle art?
To build a world and fall apart
From all the noise I knew before?
A quiet knock... I close the door...
So fragile, like a wisp of cloud
I never have to say out loud...

[Chorus]
That when I close my eyes and fall
Through porcelain hours, soft and slow
I'll tint the air with lilac glow
And let my silent garden grow
This is the quiet I can hold
A story that will not be told`,

Where the loneliness ends and hopes begin
Just a pale horizon, a fragile seam
Awake inside a hazy dream
Suspended in the space between

An unspoken, gentle pact
Between the person I have been
And the one the day will let back in

For the future to find this quiet place
Is this a memory or a premonition?
A silent, slow transition
Just a watercolor wash across the sky
