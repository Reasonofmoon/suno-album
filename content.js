            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
Pillow's gone cold on the other side
Nowhere left for me to hide
Ceiling stares back, a field of white
Cut in half by pale blue light
Streetlamp's drawing tracings on the wall
Waiting for a call that's not a call
And I ask the empty space beside my head
All the words I should have said

[Chorus]
Oh, the blue hour echo
Is the only sound I know
It's the beat behind the beat, quiet and slow
Just the sound of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... hello, you

[Verse 2]
Static hums on the window glass
Watching hazy silhouettes pass
Every ghost I used to know
Puts on another quiet show
The vinyl hiss inside my brain
Washes out just like the rain
And I trace the dust that dances in the beam
Living out a waking dream

[Chorus]
Oh, the blue hour echo
Is the only sound I know
It's the beat behind the beat, quiet and slow
Just the sound of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... hello, you

[Bridge]
Is this a kind of peace I've found?
This quiet, hollow, sacred ground?
Or is it just a slow release
From a world that will not cease?
This voice that answers in the grey
Does it want me to run or stay?

[Chorus]
It's the blue hour echo
The only sound I really know
A rhythm in the blood, quiet and slow
The hum of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... it's only you`,
