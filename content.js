(Static noise fades in)
No roots. No center.
Just lines.
Lines of flight.
(Beat drops - heavy, broken, glitchy)

[Verse 1]
We are tired of trees, tired of roots
Tracing the same old path, looking for truth
But the truth isn't buried, it's spreading out
Like grass, like weeds, erasing the doubt
One becomes two, but not as a twin
Multiplicity starts where the edges begin
Connect the beat to the noise, the voice to the void
Every structure you built, is meant to be destroyed

[Chorus]
Rhizome. Connect.
Any point to any point.
Rhizome. Forget.
The hierarchy, the joint.
Map the map, don't trace the trace.
We are nomads in a smooth space.
(Rhizome, Rhizome, infinite space)

[Verse 2]
The General wants a grid, a rigid design
But we slip through the cracks, curving the line
A book is a machine, a song is a gear
Plug it into the world, make the invisible clear
Wasps and orchids, dancing a code
Deterritorialize, explode the mode
No beginning, no end, just the middle state
Intermezzo living, accelerating fate

[Outro]
(Beat glitches and slows down)
And... and... and...
Always in the middle.
Becoming.
(Fade to white noise)`,

            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
Three-fifteen paints the ceiling
Just a low and hazy feeling
Dusty fan is turning slow
In the phone's electric glow
Street outside is holding its breath
And I'm caught somewhere 'tween life and death
Just a ghost inside these sheets
Listening to my own heartbeats

[Chorus]
Pale moon, heavy eyes
Painting truths in silver lies
In this quiet, private space
Time and thought begin to race
Yeah, the world is fast asleep
But my promises won't keep
Pale moon, heavy eyes
Watching for the sun to rise

[Verse 2]
Every window is a screen
Playing back a faded scene
Conversations in my head
All the fragile words I said
Hear the sub-bass of my doubt
Try so hard to tune it out
But the silence makes it loud
A lonely, luminous cloud

[Chorus]
Pale moon, heavy eyes
Painting truths in silver lies
In this quiet, private space
Time and thought begin to race
Yeah, the world is fast asleep
But my promises won't keep
Pale moon, heavy eyes
Watching for the sun to rise

[Bridge]
And there's a clarity in the blur
A whispered truth, a gentle stir
From the corner of my eye
One single drop is passing by
Is it a tear or just the light?
Burning oh so blue and bright
In this moment, I can see
Every single part of me

[Chorus]
Pale moon, heavy eyes
Painting truths in silver lies
In this quiet, private space
Time and thought begin to race
Yeah, the world is fast asleep
But my promises won't keep
Pale moon, heavy eyes
Watching for the sun to rise`,
