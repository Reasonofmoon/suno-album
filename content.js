(Static noise fades in)
No roots. No center.
Just lines.
Lines of flight.
(Beat drops - heavy, broken, glitchy)

[Verse 1]
We are tired of trees, tired of roots
Tracing the same old path, looking for truth
But the truth isn't buried, it's spreading out
Like grass, like weeds, erasing the doubt
One becomes two, but not as a twin
Multiplicity starts where the edges begin
Connect the beat to the noise, the voice to the void
Every structure you built, is meant to be destroyed

[Chorus]
Rhizome. Connect.
Any point to any point.
Rhizome. Forget.
The hierarchy, the joint.
Map the map, don't trace the trace.
We are nomads in a smooth space.
(Rhizome, Rhizome, infinite space)

[Verse 2]
The General wants a grid, a rigid design
But we slip through the cracks, curving the line
A book is a machine, a song is a gear
Plug it into the world, make the invisible clear
Wasps and orchids, dancing a code
Deterritorialize, explode the mode
No beginning, no end, just the middle state
Intermezzo living, accelerating fate

[Outro]
(Beat glitches and slows down)
And... and... and...
Always in the middle.
Becoming.
(Fade to white noise)`,
