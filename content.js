            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
Pillow's gone cold on the other side
Nowhere left for me to hide
Ceiling stares back, a field of white
Cut in half by pale blue light
Streetlamp's drawing tracings on the wall
Waiting for a call that's not a call
And I ask the empty space beside my head
All the words I should have said

[Chorus]
Oh, the blue hour echo
Is the only sound I know
It's the beat behind the beat, quiet and slow
Just the sound of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... hello, you

[Verse 2]
Static hums on the window glass
Watching hazy silhouettes pass
Every ghost I used to know
Puts on another quiet show
The vinyl hiss inside my brain
Washes out just like the rain
And I trace the dust that dances in the beam
Living out a waking dream

[Chorus]
Oh, the blue hour echo
Is the only sound I know
It's the beat behind the beat, quiet and slow
Just the sound of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... hello, you

[Bridge]
Is this a kind of peace I've found?
This quiet, hollow, sacred ground?
Or is it just a slow release
From a world that will not cease?
This voice that answers in the grey
Does it want me to run or stay?

[Chorus]
It's the blue hour echo
The only sound I really know
A rhythm in the blood, quiet and slow
The hum of my own thoughts, soft and low
Fading in, fading through
Hello, me... it's only you`,

            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
The pane is cool against my hand tonight
Watching silver rivers chase the light
A muted beat is pulsing in the space
While vinyl static puts on a soft-worn face
And through the haze, a single, simple truth
A vertical line of pale electric youth

[Chorus]
Oh, the midnight blur
A quiet lullaby of what we were
Just the neon rain that's falling on the glass
A perfect, lonely moment, built to last
A silhouette that's bathed in indigo
Watching the city breathe, soft and slow

[Verse 2]
The Rhodes chords hang like smoke inside the room
A fretless bass to navigate the gloom
Each chorus-laden guitar lick, a tear
That traces paths of hope and quiet fear
They echo off the buildings down below
A whispered melody I used to know

[Chorus]
Oh, the midnight blur
A quiet lullaby of what we were
Just the neon rain that's falling on the glass
A perfect, lonely moment, built to last
A silhouette that's bathed in indigo
Watching the city breathe, soft and slow

[Bridge]
And in this solitude, I'm not alone
I feel the city's pulse inside my bones
It isn't sad, this solitary art
It's just the steady beating of a heart
That found its rhythm in the falling sound
On this forgotten, consecrated ground

[Chorus]
Oh, the midnight blur
A quiet lullaby of what we were
Just the neon rain that's falling on the glass
A perfect, lonely moment, built to last
A silhouette that's bathed in indigo
Watching the city breathe, soft and slow`,

            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
White ceramic in my hand
A quiet island in the land
Of sleeping streets and faded light
A single window in the night
The hiss and bloom of bitter grounds
The only one of all the sounds

[Chorus]
And oh, this blue hour brew
Makes the silence feel brand new
My heartbeat is the only drum
Waiting for the sun to come
The steam curls up, a hazy truth
In my caffeine-fueled solitude

[Verse 2]
The Rhodes chords hang like dust in air
I trace the lines of a single chair
A clean guitar thought starts to stray
Reflecting on the coming day
But here, the clock has lost its hold
A story in the dark is told

[Chorus]
And oh, this blue hour brew
Makes the silence feel brand new
My heartbeat is the only drum
Waiting for the sun to come
The steam curls up, a hazy truth
In my caffeine-fueled solitude

[Bridge]
Some would call this loneliness
An empty, stark, and cold address
But it's a rhythm, soft and deep
A private promise I can keep
Where every crackle on the track
Means there is no turning back

[Chorus]
Just me and this blue hour brew
Making silence feel brand new
My heartbeat is the only drum
Waiting for the sun to come
The steam curls up, a hazy truth
In my caffeine-fueled solitude`,

            "lyrics": `[Verse 1]
Graphite lines on a paper seat
This rattle-hum is a faded beat
Window frames a pale blue smear
Watching stations disappear
Every ghost is just a name
Flickering inside the frame

[Chorus]
Floating in these fluorescent dreams
Just a ghost in the machine
While the city sleeps in seams of gray
Let the silence pull me away
Yeah, the silence pulls me away

[Verse 2]
Every street light, a memory
An echo of who I used to be
Don't know where this tunnel bends
On this quiet, my soul depends
Tracing maps on frosted glass
Hoping that the feeling lasts

[Chorus]
Floating in these fluorescent dreams
Just a ghost in the machine
While the city sleeps in seams of gray
Let the silence pull me away
Yeah, the silence pulls me away

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm not running from
Anything or anyone
Just a body in the sway
Of this empty, steel ballet
Lost between the stop and start
Just the beating of my heart

[Chorus]
Floating in these fluorescent dreams
(In these dreams)
Just a ghost in the machine
(In the machine)
While the city sleeps in seams of gray
Let the silence pull me away
Yeah, the silence pulls me away`,
